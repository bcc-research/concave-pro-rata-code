# Concave Pro-rata Games
This repository contains the code needed to generate the figures used in the paper
[Concave Pro-rata Games](https://angeris.github.io/papers/pro-rata-games.pdf).

## Requirements
The requirements for running these examples are:
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`

## How to run
The figures were generated by running
```bash
python transient_sims.py
```
and will be saved to the output directory. The simulation parameters are set to
those used in the paper but can be easily changed.
